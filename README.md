# Argus Solution
Argus is an open source information technology solution to support countries performing public health surveillance. Argus is mainly composed of an Android application to report data through SMS and a Web platform for its data management, data validation and data analysis. Argus permits countries to apply the IDSR procedures for early detection and response of public health events as requested by the International Health Regulations 2005.
Argus implementation toolbox provides guidance and tools for countries to:
- understand the functionalities of Argus;
- identify if Argus is fit for their needs;
- pilot test and evaluate Argus in an area of the country;
- scale-up Argus to the whole country if adapted.

The toolbox is composed of the following [documents](https://github.com/novelt/ArgusSolution/tree/master/documentation):
- An instruction document.
- A leaflet presenting the tool.
- A training kit composed of brochures and posters for end users and a visual presentation for training sessions.
- An evaluation kit composed of an evaluation protocol and its related questionnaires.
- An installation kit composed of an Argus architecture document and an Argus installation and administration document.
